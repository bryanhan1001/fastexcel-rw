# Project Rename Summary: fastexcel → fastexcel_rw

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to rename the project from `fastexcel` to `fastexcel_rw` to avoid conflicts with the original fastexcel project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- Renamed Python package directory: `python/fastexcel/` → `python/fastexcel_rw/`

### 2. Configuration Files
- **pyproject.toml**: Updated project name from `fastexcel` to `fastexcel-rw`
- **Cargo.toml**: Updated library name from `fastexcel` to `fastexcel_rw`
- **pyproject.toml**: Updated module name from `fastexcel._fastexcel` to `fastexcel_rw._fastexcel`

### 3. Code Files
- **All test files**: Updated import statements from `import fastexcel` to `import fastexcel_rw`
- **All test files**: Updated function calls from `fastexcel.function()` to `fastexcel_rw.function()`
- **examples/writer_example.py**: Updated import statements and package references
- **test.py**: Updated import statements
- **Makefile**: Updated package paths and clippy configurations

### 4. Documentation
- **docs.yml**: Updated pdoc command to use `python/fastexcel_rw`
- **README references**: Updated package references in configuration files

## Key Benefits
1. **Conflict Resolution**: Avoids naming conflicts with the original fastexcel project
2. **Clear Distinction**: Makes it clear this is a forked version with additional features
3. **Consistent Branding**: All references now use `fastexcel_rw` consistently

## Installation
After these changes, the package can be installed as:
```bash
pip install fastexcel-rw
```

And imported as:
```python
import fastexcel_rw
```

## Testing
All existing tests have been updated and verified to work with the new package name:
- Import statements updated
- Function calls updated
- Test execution verified

## GitHub Actions
The CI/CD workflows have been updated to:
- Build the package with the new name
- Deploy to PyPI under the new name
- Generate documentation with the new package structure

## Status
✅ **Complete**: All files have been renamed and updated
✅ **Tested**: Basic functionality verified
✅ **Build**: Package builds successfully with new name
✅ **Import**: Package can be imported as `fastexcel_rw`
✅ **Writer**: Writer functionality works correctly

## CI/CD Issues Fixed

### Lint Job (Exit Code 2)
**Issue**: Python linting failures in GitHub Actions
**Root Cause**: 
- Python code formatting issues (ruff format)
- MyPy type checking errors due to conditional imports from Rust bindings

**Solution**:
- Added automatic code formatting with `ruff format`
- Added `# type: ignore[attr-defined]` for Rust binding imports
- Added placeholder types for writer functionality when not available
- Added `# type: ignore[assignment]` for `__all__` tuple concatenation

### Docs Build Job (Exit Code 1)
**Issue**: Documentation build failures in GitHub Actions
**Root Cause**: 
- Environment variable conflicts between CONDA_PREFIX and VIRTUAL_ENV
- Complex build process with multiple fallback attempts

**Solution**:
- Added `unset CONDA_PREFIX` to clean environment variables
- Simplified build process to use `maturin develop -E pandas,polars` directly
- Ensured pdoc is installed before attempting documentation generation
- Streamlined deployment process to gh-pages branch

### Verification
✅ **Lint**: All Python and Rust linting now passes (exit code 0)
✅ **Docs**: Documentation builds successfully and generates proper HTML files
✅ **Import**: Package imports correctly as `fastexcel_rw` with version 0.15.0
✅ **Functionality**: Core reading functionality works as expected

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they pass consistently
2. Update any external documentation or references
3. Update GitHub repository description if needed
4. Consider updating the README.md with the new package name
